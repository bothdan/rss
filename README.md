rss feed

PHP assignment:
Create a class that parses out an RSS feed and returns a JSON string containing: Language(the feed can be localized),
Date(formatted as August 31, 2015), Title, Excerpt and Full Content.  The feed should be read in as a query param such
that when testing we can specify any valid rss feed.
